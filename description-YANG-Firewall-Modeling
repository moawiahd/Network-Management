Description:

Explore the world of YANG data modeling with this project focused on re-implementing the firewall table model. Utilizing YANG in place of SMIv2, this project enhances flexibility and efficiency in representing firewall rules.

Project Details:

Objective: 
Gain hands-on experience with YANG data modeling for firewall table representation.
  
Key Features:
Define firewall rules with details like Source/Destination MAC addresses, Source/Destination IP addresses, TCP/UDP port numbers, Protocol type (TCP, UDP, or ICMP), Action (accept, drop, or reject), and matched packet count.
Enable RESTCONF client to retrieve and modify data in the firewall table, excluding the matched packet count for a given rule.
Ensure all information/data nodes are mandatory, with appropriate data types and classifications (configuration or state data).
Conform to YANG 1.1 RFC standards.
Validate the model using the pyang tool to ensure a clean structure without errors or warnings.
  
Hints:
Leverage YANG list data nodes for constructing a table.
Start with the provided simple example-system YANG module, building upon it.
Investigate and draw inspiration from existing standard YANG modules like IETF's or OpenConfig's interfaces.
Use pyang --tree-help for a comprehensive explanation of symbols in the tree output.
