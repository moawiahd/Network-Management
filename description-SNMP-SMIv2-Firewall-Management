Dive into the world of SNMP SMIv2 data modeling with this hands-on assignment. The goal is to create an SNMP MIB module, named ID-xxxxxx (replace 'xxxxxx' with your student ID), enabling efficient management (querying and manipulation) of the firewall table on a machine.

Project Details:

Objective: Acquire hands-on experience with SMIv2 data modeling language to write an SNMP MIB module for firewall table management.
Problem Statement: Develop an SNMP MIB module that allows querying and manipulation of firewall rules using SNMP.
Requirements:
The module resides under the enterprises node, descending from the node nes470(9000).
Each firewall table entry contains information such as Source/Destination MAC addresses, Source/Destination IP addresses, Source/Destination TCP/UDP port numbers, Protocol type (TCP, UDP, or ICMP), Action (accept, drop, or reject), and the number of matched packets.
SNMP manager can retrieve all data from the firewall table.
SNMP manager can modify all data in the firewall table, excluding the number of matched packets for a given rule.
Managed objects have appropriate access permissions and data types.
The module conforms to the SMIv2 RFC (RFC 2578).
Validation using the smilint tool with severity level 4 produces no errors and no warnings.
Hints:
Start with and build upon the skeletal MIB module presented in Section 5.7 of RFC 2578.
Explore and mimic existing standard MIB modules, such as the IETF's interfaces MIB module.
